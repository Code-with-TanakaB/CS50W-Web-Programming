houses = {"harry": "Gryffindor", "draco": "Slytherin"} #creating a dictionary called houses with two key-value pairs. The keys are "harry" and "draco", and the values are "Gryffindor" and "Slytherin", respectively.

houses["ron"] = "Gryffindor" #adding a new key-value pair to the houses dictionary. The key is "ron" and the value is "Gryffindor". This is done using square bracket notation, where the key is placed inside the brackets and the value is assigned using the equals sign.

print(houses["ron"]) #accessing the value associated with the key "ron" in the houses dictionary and printing it. This is done using square bracket notation, where the key is placed inside the brackets to retrieve the corresponding value.
