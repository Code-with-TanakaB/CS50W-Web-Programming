coordinateX = 10.0
coordinateY = 20.0

coordinate = (10.0, 20.0) #creating a tuple called coordinate that contains two floating-point numbers, 10.0 and 20.0. A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items, and in this case, it is used to represent a pair of coordinates (x and y) in a 2D space. The first element of the tuple (10.0) represents the x-coordinate, and the second element (20.0) represents the y-coordinate.
